## About
This is a K-Means algorithm written in Python. It is using the Iris dataset ([Data-Set Link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris))

On execution of this application, the program will give you a graph of the centroids and the data that came from the data-set. It will show how the algorithm bunches the data at their closest centroid.

Additional statistics will also be provided such as a graph of the Elbow Points, which show at which values of K the algorithm works best.

## What is K-Means?

- K-Means is a machine-learning algorithm which is unsupervised, meaning it dosen't need a human in the loop

- What it does is, from a data-set it groups data values together to points called Clusters

There are 2 inputs for this algorithm:

**1. K = The number of clusters**

**2. Data = Data from the Data-Set**

- Every data-point is assigned to its closest cluster, whilst keeping the amount of clusters as small as possible, for maximum optimisation
