## About
This is a K-Means algorithm written in Python. It is using the Iris dataset ([Data-Set Link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris))

On execution of this application, the program will give you a graph of the centroids and the data that came from the data-set. It will show how the algorithm bunches the data at their closest centroid.

Additional statistics will also be provided such as a graph of the Elbow Points, which show at which values of K the algorithm works best.
